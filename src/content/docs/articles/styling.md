``` r
library(cqtkit)
```

Every cqtkit plotting function returns a `ggplot` object and takes a
`style` argument. As of 1.2.0 that argument accepts a `style_spec()`
from [ggstylekit](https://github.com/a2-ai/ggstylekit) alongside the
style list that `set_style()` builds. The two are told apart by class,
so an existing call keeps the styling engine it has always used and
produces the figure it has always produced. The list form is deprecated
and will be removed in 2.0.0.

Only plots styled with a `style_spec()` carry the state ggstylekit
needs, so `reveal()` and `restyle_plot()` work on them and error on
list-styled plots. A bare `style_spec()` gives the house figure. This
vignette leans hard on that integration: it styles and `reveal()`s
aggressively so that each plot exercises a different slice of the
styling surface.

## The `style` argument

`style_spec()` fields cover labels, limits, per-series aesthetics, and
the theme all at once.

``` r
eda_qt_rr_plot(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, RR, QT, ID, TRTG,
  model_type = "lm",
  style = style_spec(
    title = "QT vs RR",
    xlabel = "RR interval (ms)",
    ylabel = bquote("QT interval (" * italic(t) * ", ms)"),
    xlims = c(600, 1400),
    colors = c("Placebo" = "grey60", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"),
    point_alpha = 0.5,
    point_size = 1.5,
    theme = ggplot2::theme_minimal()
  )
) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = c("shapes", "facet"), on = "point")
```

## Captions

Generated captions are defaults. Use `style_spec(caption = "...")` to
replace one, or `caption = ""` to hide it. Captions can also be changed
after plotting with `restyle_plot()`.

``` r
eda_scatter_with_regressions(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, deltaQTCF, CONC, TRTG,
  style = style_spec(caption = "Verapamil study")
) |>
  restyle_plot(caption = "Verapamil study: observed concentration and QTcF change")
```

![](/figures/styling/style-caption-1.png)

## Legends

`legend_spec()` controls the title, position, wrapping, and entry labels
of a channel’s legend.

``` r
eda_qt_rr_plot(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, RR, QT, ID, TRTG,
  model_type = "lm",
  style = style_spec(
    colors = c("Placebo" = "grey60", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legends = legend_spec(
      channel = "color",
      title = "Treatment arm",
      nrow = 1,
      labels = c("Verapamil HCL" = "Verapamil")
    )
  )
)
```

![](/figures/styling/style-legend-1.png)

## Revealing a covariate

`reveal()` maps a carried covariate onto a free aesthetic. A
**continuous** covariate becomes a colorbar; a **discrete** one a keyed
legend. Reveals chain.

``` r
eda_qt_rr_plot(cqtkit_data_verapamil, RR, QT, ID, model_type = "lm", style = style_spec()) |>
  reveal(AGE, as = "color", on = "point")
```

![](/figures/styling/reveal-continuous-1.png)

``` r
eda_qt_rr_plot(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, RR, QT, ID, TRTG,
  model_type = "lm",
  style = style_spec(colors = c("Placebo" = "grey60", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"))
) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = "shapes", on = "point", legends = legend_spec(channel = "shape", title = "Sex")) |>
  reveal(RACE, as = "facet")
```

![](/figures/styling/reveal-chained-1.png)

# Exploratory plots

## `eda_qt_rr_plot()`

Continuous size reveal plus a discrete facet, on a log-x axis with
custom breaks.

``` r
eda_qt_rr_plot(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, RR, QT, ID,
  model_type = "lm",
  style = style_spec(
    logx = TRUE,
    xbreaks = c(700, 900, 1100, 1300),
    point_alpha = 0.4
  )
) |>
  reveal(WGHT, as = "size", legends = legend_spec(title = "Weight (kg)")) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = "facet")
```

![](/figures/styling/eda-qt-rr-1.png)

## `eda_qtc_comparison_plot()`

A multi-panel patchwork. One `style_spec()` hits every panel, and a
continuous color reveal is grafted across the whole patchwork.

``` r
eda_qtc_comparison_plot(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, RR, QT, QTCB, QTCF,
  id_col = ID, trt_col = TRTG,
  model_type = "lme", remove_rr_iiv = TRUE,
  style = style_spec(
    colors = c("Placebo" = "grey60", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"),
    point_alpha = 0.4,
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
) |>
  reveal(WGHT, as = "color", on = "point",
         legends = legend_spec(title = "Weight (kg)"))
```

![](/figures/styling/eda-qtc-comparison-1.png)

## `eda_quantiles_plot()`

Aggregated (not reveal-able), so this leans on style: log axes,
relabeled legend entries, and plotted observations.

``` r
eda_quantiles_plot(
  dplyr::filter(cqtkit_data_verapamil, DOSE > 0),
  CONC, QTCF, trt_col = TRTG,
  plot_observations = TRUE,
  style = style_spec(
    logx = TRUE,
    logy = TRUE,
    xlabel = "Concentration (ng/mL, log)",
    ylabel = "QTcF (ms, log)",
    colors = c("Placebo" = "grey60", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"),
    legends = legend_spec(
      channel = "color", title = "Arm",
      labels = c("Verapamil HCL" = "Verapamil")
    )
  )
)
```

![](/figures/styling/eda-quantiles-1.png)

## `eda_scatter_with_regressions()`

Reference lines and regression lines share a `linetype` legend (with
relabeled entries). Color is free, so a discrete covariate is revealed
onto the points, and legend order is set explicitly.

``` r
eda_scatter_with_regressions(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, deltaQTCF, CONC, TRTG,
  reference_threshold = c(-10, 10),
  style = style_spec(
    xlabel = "Concentration (ng/mL)",
    ylabel = bquote(Delta ~ "QTcF (ms)"),
    colors = c("Placebo" = "grey60", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"),
    point_alpha = 0.4,
    legends = list(
      legend_spec(channel = "color", title = "Treatment", order = 1),
      legend_spec(
        channel = "linetype", title = "Regressions", order = 2,
        labels = c("Reference -10" = "+/-10 ms", "Reference 10" = NA)
      )
    )
  )
) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = "shapes", on = "point",
         legends = legend_spec(title = "Sex"))
```

![](/figures/styling/eda-scatter-1.png)

The fit and reference lines are named series (`"LOESS Regression"`,
`"Linear Regression"`, `"Reference <threshold>"`), so the per-series
maps restyle them by name just like data series:

``` r
eda_scatter_with_regressions(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, deltaQTCF, CONC, TRTG,
  reference_threshold = c(-10, 10),
  style = style_spec(
    colors = c(
      "LOESS Regression" = "firebrick",
      "Linear Regression" = "grey40",
      "Reference 10" = "orange",
      "Reference -10" = "orange"
    ),
    fill = c("LOESS Regression" = "mistyrose"),
    linetypes = c("LOESS Regression" = "solid")
  )
)
```

![](/figures/styling/eda-scatter-series-1.png)

## `eda_mean_dv_over_time()`

Aggregated with a PK overlay (secondary axis) and error bars. The
reference line has its own `linetype` legend entry.

``` r
eda_mean_dv_over_time(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, deltaQTCF, NTLD, DOSEF,
  secondary_data_col = CONC,
  group_col = TRTG, reference_threshold = 10, error_bars = "CI",
  style = style_spec(
    ylabel = bquote("Mean " ~ Delta ~ "QTcF (ms)"),
    xlabel = "Time (h)",
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend_nrow = 2
  )
)
```

![](/figures/styling/eda-mean-dv-1.png)

Each point is the mean of one `dosef_col` level at one time, so the plot
data carries only the columns with one value per point. Stacking two
studies that both label placebo `"0 mg"` pools their placebo subjects,
and `STUDY` is not carried. `group_col = STUDY` gives each study its own
points, and `reveal()` can then facet by it.

``` r
studies <- rbind(
  transform(cqtkit_data_verapamil, STUDY = "Verapamil"),
  transform(cqtkit_data_dofetilide, STUDY = "Dofetilide")
)

eda_mean_dv_over_time(
  studies, deltaQTCF, NTLD, DOSEF,
  group_col = STUDY, error_bars = "SD",
  style = style_spec(legends = legend_spec(channel = "colors", title = "Dosing Regimens"))
) |>
  reveal(STUDY, as = "facet", facet_scales = "free_x")
```

![](/figures/styling/eda-mean-dv-studies-1.png)

## `eda_hysteresis_loop_plot()`

``` r
p1 <- eda_hysteresis_loop_plot(
  droplevels(dplyr::filter(cqtkit_data_verapamil, DOSE > 0)),
  NTLD, deltaQTCF, CONC, DOSEF,
  style = style_spec(
    ylabel = bquote(Delta ~ "QTcF (ms)"),
    xlabel = "Concentration (ng/mL)",
    theme = ggplot2::theme_minimal(),
    legends = legend_spec(channel = 'color', hide = TRUE)
  )
)

p2 <- eda_hysteresis_loop_plot(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil,
  NTLD, deltaQTCF, CONC, DOSEF,
  reference_dose = "0 mg",
  style = style_spec(
    ylabel = bquote(Delta ~ Delta ~ "QTcF (ms)"),
    xlabel = "Concentration (ng/mL)",
    theme = ggplot2::theme_minimal(),
    legends = legend_spec(channel = 'color', hide = TRUE)
  )
)

ggstylekit::combine_styled_plots(p1, p2, axes = "collect_x")
```

![](/figures/styling/eda-hysteresis-1.png)

# Goodness-of-fit plots

``` r
fit <- fit_prespecified_model(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil,
  deltaQTCF, ID, CONC, deltaQTCFBL, TRTG, TAFD,
  method = "REML", remove_conc_iiv = TRUE
)
```

## `gof_plots()`

Three legends collected across a 2x2 patchwork: treatment on color, and
SEX revealed onto both point shapes and the histogram fill, with
explicit ordering. The loess smooths here are the same
`"LOESS Regression"` series as in the eda plots, so one
`colors = c("LOESS Regression" = ...)` entry recolors them too.

``` r
gof_plots(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, fit, deltaQTCF, CONC, NTLD, TRTG,
  style = style_spec(
    colors = c("Placebo" = "grey60", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"),
    point_alpha = 0.5,
    legends = legend_spec(channel = "color", title = "Treatment", order = 1),
    legend.position = "right"
  )
) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = "shapes", on = "point",
         legends = legend_spec(channel = "shape", title = "Sex", order = 2)) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = "fill", on = "bar", fill = c(F = "pink", M = "steelblue"),
         legends = legend_spec(channel = "fill", title = "Sex", order = 3))
#> Warning: reveal(): revealed 3 of 4 eligible panels; skipped panel 4: `on`

#> Warning: reveal(): revealed 1 of 4 eligible panels; skipped panel 1: `on`

#> [] and series [F, M, Placebo, Verapamil HCL].; panel 3: `on` matches nothing
#> for fill; this plot has entities [] and series [F, M, Placebo, Verapamil HCL]..
```

## `gof_concordance_plots()`

A continuous covariate revealed as a colorbar onto the points, with
facets by SEX laid out in two rows.

``` r
gof_concordance_plots(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, fit, deltaQTCF, CONC, NTLD, TRTG,
  style = style_spec(
    colors = c("Placebo" = "grey60", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
) |>
  reveal(AGE, as = "color", on = "point",
         legends = legend_spec(channel = "color", title = "Age (y)")) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = "facet", facet_nrow = 2)
```

![](/figures/styling/gof-concordance-1.png)

## `gof_residuals_plots()`

Discrete covariate revealed onto shapes across the panels.

``` r
gof_residuals_plots(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, fit, deltaQTCF, CONC, NTLD, TRTG,
  style = style_spec(
    colors = c("Placebo" = "grey60", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = "shapes", on = "point", legends = legend_spec(channel = "shape", title = "Sex"))
```

![](/figures/styling/gof-residuals-1.png)

## `gof_qq_plots()`

``` r
gof_qq_plots(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, fit, deltaQTCF, CONC, NTLD, TRTG,
  style = style_spec(
    colors = c("Placebo" = "grey60", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
)
```

![](/figures/styling/gof-qq-1.png)

## `gof_residuals_time_boxplots()`

Treatment on `fill` with reduced alpha; SEX revealed onto the box
outline color with a thicker line; reference lines keep their own
`linetype` legend.

``` r
gof_residuals_time_boxplots(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, fit, deltaQTCF, CONC, NTLD, TRTG,
  style = style_spec(
    fill = c("Placebo" = "grey70", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"),
    box_alpha = 0.4,
    legends = legend_spec(channel = "fill", title = "Treatment"),
    legend.position = "right"
  )
) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = "color", on = "box", colors = c(F = "firebrick", M = "navy"),
         box_linewidth = 0.5, legends = legend_spec(channel = "color", title = "Sex"))
```

![](/figures/styling/gof-resid-time-box-1.png)

## `gof_residuals_trt_boxplots()`

``` r
gof_residuals_trt_boxplots(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, fit, deltaQTCF, CONC, NTLD, TRTG,
  style = style_spec(
    fill = c("Placebo" = "grey70", "Verapamil HCL" = "steelblue"),
    box_alpha = 0.5,
    legends = legend_spec(channel = "fill", title = "Treatment"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
)
```

![](/figures/styling/gof-resid-trt-box-1.png)

## `gof_vpc_plot()`

Percentile lines own the color channel, so SEX is revealed onto shapes.

``` r
set.seed(804831)
gof_vpc_plot(cqtkit_data_verapamil, fit, CONC, deltaQTCF, nruns = 10, style = style_spec()) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = "shapes", on = "point",
         legends = legend_spec(channel = "shape", title = "Sex"))
#> Warning in compute_quantiles_obs_df(data, !!xdata, !!dv, conf_int = conf_int, :
#> Your xdata quantiles had duplicates. Filtering for x values > 0
```

![](/figures/styling/gof-vpc-1.png)

# Exposure-response predictions

## `predict_with_observations_plot()`

The observations carry the full dataset, so a covariate can be revealed
onto them. This holds for both the single-treatment (ΔQTcF) form and the
contrast (ΔΔQTcF) form built with `control_predictors`.

Single treatment:

``` r
predict_with_observations_plot(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, fit, CONC, deltaQTCF,
  treatment_predictors = list(
    CONC = 0, deltaQTCFBL = 0, TRTG = "Verapamil HCL", TAFD = "0.5 HR"
  ),
  reference_threshold = 10,
  style = style_spec(ylabel = bquote(Delta ~ "QTcF (ms)"))
) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = "shapes", on = "point",
         legends = legend_spec(channel = "shape", title = "Sex"))
```

![](/figures/styling/predict-observations-1.png)

Placebo-corrected contrast (ΔΔQTcF), revealing the same covariate on the
contrast observations:

``` r
predict_with_observations_plot(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, fit, CONC, deltaQTCF,
  id_col = ID, ntime_col = NTLD, trt_col = TRTG,
  treatment_predictors = list(
    CONC = 0, deltaQTCFBL = 0, TRTG = "Verapamil HCL", TAFD = "2 HR"
  ),
  control_predictors = list(
    CONC = 0, deltaQTCFBL = 0, TRTG = "Placebo", TAFD = "2 HR"
  ),
  reference_threshold = c(-10, 10),
  style = style_spec(ylabel = bquote(Delta ~ Delta ~ "QTcF (ms)"))
) |>
  reveal(SEX, as = "shapes", on = "point",
         legends = legend_spec(channel = "shape", title = "Sex"))
```

![](/figures/styling/predict-observations-contrast-1.png)

## `predict_with_quantiles_plot()`

``` r
predict_with_quantiles_plot(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, fit, CONC, deltaQTCF,
  treatment_predictors = list(
    CONC = 0, deltaQTCFBL = 0, TRTG = "Verapamil HCL", TAFD = "0.5 HR"
  ),
  reference_threshold = 10, error_bars = "CI",
  style = style_spec(
    ylabel = bquote(Delta ~ "QTcF (ms)"),
    xlabel = "Concentration (ng/mL)"
  )
)
#> Warning in compute_quantiles_obs_df(observed_df, conc, dv, conf_int, nbins =
#> nbins): Your xdata quantiles had duplicates. Filtering for x values > 0
```

![](/figures/styling/predict-quantiles-1.png)

## `predict_with_exposure_plot()`

`cmaxes` marks exposure levels via the geometric-mean Cmax.

``` r
pk_df <- compute_pk_parameters(
  dplyr::filter(cqtkit_data_verapamil, DOSE != 0), ID, DOSEF, CONC, NTLD
)

predict_with_exposure_plot(
  cqtkit_data_verapamil, fit, CONC,
  treatment_predictors = list(
    CONC = 0, deltaQTCFBL = 0, TRTG = "Verapamil HCL", TAFD = "0.5 HR"
  ),
  cmaxes = pk_df[[1, "Cmax_gm"]],
  reference_threshold = 10,
  style = style_spec(ylabel = bquote(Delta ~ "QTcF (ms)"))
)
```

![](/figures/styling/predict-exposure-1.png)

# Migrating from `set_style()`

`set_style()` and `style_plot()` are deprecated in 1.2.0 and warn when
called. Passing `style` a list still works and does not warn. All three
will be removed in 2.0.0. `style_spec()`, `legend_spec()`, `reveal()`,
and `restyle_plot()` are re-exported from ggstylekit, so nothing here
needs `library(ggstylekit)`.

| Deprecated | Current |
|----|----|
| `set_style(title, xlabel, ylabel, xlims, ylims, colors, shapes, logx, logy, legend.position, legend.title.position, legend.title.hjust, caption_hjust, fill_alpha, legend_nrow)` | `style_spec()` with the same argument names |
| `style = list(title = "...")` | `style = style_spec(title = "...")` |
| `set_style(labels = c(A = "a", B = NA))` | `legend_spec(channel = "color", labels = c(A = "a", B = NA))`; an `NA` label still hides the entry |
| `set_style(legend = "Treatment")` | `legend_spec(channel = "color", title = "Treatment")` |
| `set_style(shape_legend = , fill_legend = )` | `legend_spec(channel = "shape", title = )`, `legend_spec(channel = "fill", title = )` |
| `set_style(color_order = , shape_order = , fill_order = , linetype_order = )` | `legend_spec(channel = , order = )` |
| `style_plot(p, ...)` | `restyle_plot(p, ...)` with `style_spec()` field names |

Legend specs go in `style_spec(legends = list(...))`, one per channel.

Do not call `library(ggstylekit)` while both styling APIs exist. Both
packages export `set_style` and `style_plot`, they are unrelated
functions, and whichever package is attached second wins. Anything in
ggstylekit beyond the four re-exports should be qualified, as
`ggstylekit::series_layer()`.
