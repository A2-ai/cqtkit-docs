# `cqtkit` Goodness-of-Fit Functions

These functions generate plots for validating the fitted model to the data.

<Steps>
1. [`gof_plots`](../gof_plots) - This function generates a summary of GoF plots.
1. [`gof_concordance_plots`](../gof_concordance_plots) - This function generates concordance plots for Individual- and Population-predictions.
1. [`gof_residuals_plots`](../gof_residuals_plots) - This function generates a plot of residuals against dependent and independent variable.
1. [`gof_qq_plots`](../gof_qq_plots) - This function generates a QQ plot from the model.
1. [`gof_residuals_time_boxplots`](../gof_residuals_time_boxplots) - This function generates a boxplot of residuals against time data (categorical).
1. [`gof_residuals_trt_boxplots`](../gof_residuals_trt_boxplots) - This function generates a boxplot of residuals against the treatment group.
1. [`gof_vpc_plot`](../gof_vpc_plot) - This function generates a Visual Predictive Check of the model.
