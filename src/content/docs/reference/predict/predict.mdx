# `cqtkit` Prediction Functions
These functions use a fitted model to make plots of model predictions.

<Steps>
1. [`predict_with_observations_plot`](../predict_with_observations_plot) - This generates a plot with all observations of time-matched ($\Delta$)$\Delta$QTc and Concentration data with model predictions overlaid with confidence intervals.
1. [`predict_with_quantiles_plot`](../predict_with_quantiles_plot) - This function generates a plot with binned concentration values and average ($\Delta$)$\Delta$QTc for each bin with model predictions overlaid with confidence intervals.
1. [`predict_with_exposure_plot`](../predict_with_exposure_plot) - This function generates a plot with model predictions over the range of observed Concentration data with dashed lines for (supra)therapeutic $C_{\text{max}}$(s).
